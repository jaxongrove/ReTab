Edge Extension to save and load tabs in current window


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Liscense Information:

ICON: <a target="_blank" href="https://icons8.com/icon/xszfcB7Zvrlu/import-file">Import File</a> icon by <a target="_blank" href="https://icons8.com">Icons8</a>

Everything Else: Free to use and distribute

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Info:

This extension is made for Edge, but might be able to be adapted to other browsers.

Tabs are saved to a file as URLs on seperate lines, and that file is downloaded.

The file can be opened by the extension to reload the URLs in the current window.

To avoid errors, the file name should always contain ".txt" at the end.

Icon can be replaced by any 48x48 or 128x128 PNG. The file should be named "icon.png" and put in the folder. Delete the old "icon.png" and reload the extension in the extension manager. 

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Setup:

Create a folder for the extension files.

Download all the files (except README) from this repo to the folder.

In Edge, click the Extensions button in the top right (jigsaw piece button).

Open Manage Extensions.

Click Load Unpacked, and naviage into your extension folder and hit Select Folder.

Optional: Hit the Extensions button again and press "Show in Toolbar" for easy access to RasterTab.
